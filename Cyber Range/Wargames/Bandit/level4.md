# Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the **inhere** directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

# Idea

`cd inhere`, and we find there are 9 file ,use `file ./*` to look all file type and we find -file07 is ASCII text, so we `cat ./-file07`

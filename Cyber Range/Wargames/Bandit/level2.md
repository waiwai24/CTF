# Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file called **spaces in this filename** located in the home directory



# Ideas

Files in Linux usually don't contain spaces, because it is a terrible thing.

two way to open this file:

```
cat "spaces in this filename" 引号
```

```
cat ./spaces\ in \ this \filename 转义符
```
